\section*{Import of data from .csv to .root}
To store and read data, we wanted to use the tree data structure introduced to us in this course during the last couple of weeks. Therefore, the first step was to create a data conversion macro, which takes a .csv file as an input and outputs a .root file containing a tree of the data. Since (almost) all of the data sets we were given have identical format, we could be fairly specific about how to read the data from the .csv file.
